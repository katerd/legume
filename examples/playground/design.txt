	~ To enter the game players must:
		1. type in a name (the user's name is used by default for ease of testing).
		2. click 'join game' or press enter.

	~ The player's avatar is a circle with an arrow showing the direction the player is facing.
	~ To move around players use the WSAD or arrow keys.
	~ To look around players use the mouse - the direction they are facing does not relate to their
		direction of movement.
	~ To shoot their gun the player clicks the left mouse button.
